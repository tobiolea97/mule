# Threads

Java threads allow the execution of multiple tasks at the same time. This is achieved by creating multiple threads and running them concurrently. Threads are lightweight sub-processes that share the same memory space and can be executed in parallel.

The benefits of using threads include:
- **Improved performance**: Threads can be used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which can improve the overall performance of an application.
- **Responsive user interface**: By using threads, you can keep the user interface responsive while performing time-consuming tasks in the background.
- **Simplified programming**: Threads can simplify the programming of complex applications by allowing different tasks to be executed concurrently.
